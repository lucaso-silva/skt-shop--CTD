## Overview
This Page is being developed to improve my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming abilities.

The layout was based on a [design template](https://www.figma.com/file/VH0R5712lojInJ0ZmcqDAj/Skateboard-Design-Community-(Community)?node-id=1-279&t=p2fZOFPnKluA6ZzQ-0) created by Mohit Kapkoti and found in Figma. 

> Status: Developing 🚧
